					<desc>
						<eng>The fabled Darkmoor! I’ve studied the history of this place. A floating island once covered by lush gardens and beautiful glades, where the wealthy decadents of a lost age could enjoy the sight of the Inkheart swirling out there, in the void. But as one of the manifest points in the Ring, where Portals can appear during the cycles, the whole island was turned into one of the Deathtrap Strongholds. The side effects of arcane machines transformed the beautiful gardens into a haunted bog and the deadly skirmishes of the previous cycles destroyed all that what was left. I wish I could have seen it in its prime.</eng>

						<eng>II. - Pale Keep</eng>
					</name>
					<desc>
						<eng>This place feels haunted, but at least it gives me some sense of protection. It’s comforting to see walls for a change, even if there isn’t much left of them. I shouldn’t be surprised. According to my notes, this place used to be a colossal fort built of the marble bones of some long-forgotten species of the Ink. And being one of the first Strongholds, constructed right before the first cycle, the constant swarms have already reduced it to rubble. Still, I’m fairly confident that it can withstand another tide of monstrosities if I can just use its defenses to my advantage.</eng>
					</desc>
					<tier2>
						<eng>Make good use of the Whirlblade Columns located on this map, as they all deal massive damage to the monsters.</eng>
					</tier2>
					<tier3>
						<eng>Beware! This map has no Mystic Tower slots. Also, waves of monsters will vary between Horde and Armored creatures, so you might have to plan or rethink your trap building accordingly.</eng>
					</tier3>
					<tier4>
						<eng>This map has various clusters for Summoning trap slots. Try to build different kinds of traps there instead of piling up traps of the same type in one place.</eng>

					<name>
						<eng>III. - Forest of the Fallen</eng>
					</name>
					<desc>
						<eng>The First Swarm burst out of the Inkheart ages ago, before the Trapmakers had even began to experiment with the first arcane defensive mechanisms, so the Void Kingdoms had no choice but to gather a huge army to stop the monsters that were tearing through the portals of the Ring, destroying the islands one by one.  According to our annals, the bloodiest battle took place here, where the armies eventually managed to stop the tide, but they paid a terrible price: these forests are still haunted by sad presence of the countless thousands  who sacrificed their lives among the trees.</eng>
					</desc>
					<tier2>
						<eng>The Pillars of Rejuvenation will heal your creatures and your character continuously. With these Pillars and some careful planning you can stand your ground for a very long time. The effect of the Pillars in close vicinity will stack.</eng>
					</tier2>
					<tier3>
						<eng>You will face fast moving groups of monsters on this map, who can easily overrun your defenses. Hook Grinders can cut their numbers down, Salvage Recyclers can provide the extra funds.</eng>
					</tier3>
					<tier4>
						<eng>This map has several nodes where the pathways converge. It could be useful to build your defenses accordingly. Apart from the special traps unique to this map, you can only use Mystic Tower traps and Mechanical Ground trap slots.</eng>

						<eng>IV. - Bottomless Pit</eng>
					</name>
					<desc>
						<eng>The Ink is a treacherous realm, where reality twists into pockets of incredible anomalies. The closer you get to the Inkheart, the more disturbing these distorted realms become. Some of these ancient strongholds were constructed in the bowels of an infinite cave system that folds into itself and at some places the ground opens into the lightless void. Legends say that those monsters from the previous swarms who were cast into the depths are still falling and failed to touch bottom yet. Are they still alive? This is a question you might not want to ask before your next battle.</eng>
					</desc>
					<tier2>
						<eng>Squash Traps can smash even the largest monsters into pulp. Try not to waste their potential.</eng>
					</tier2>
					<tier3>
						<eng>Beware! Flying monsters will take shortcuts on this map. Whirlblade Columns and Empower Beacons will help you to deal with the rest.</eng>
					</tier3>
					<tier4>
						<eng>This map has only Ground traps and Mechanical Tower slots. Bear in mind that the waves will include Armored and Flying creatures.</eng>

				<DT05_Golem>
					<name>
						<eng>V. - Crystal Vaults</eng>
					</name>
					<desc>
						<eng>Just look at this colossal vault! This underground stronghold was built above a gaping chasm that opens straight into an entirely different world – or at least that’s what the ancient annals say. However, this is not what makes this fortress so unique. The scholars of a bygone era spent decades studying the crystals that still grow on the ledges and cliffs, only to discover that these glowing outgrowths absorbed the incredible arcane energies that once destroyed the Second Swarm. Sadly the methods of tapping into this power have been lost to us since then.</eng>
					</desc>
					<tier2>
						<eng>The Imprisoned Golems will be your mighty allies in this battle, but you can only build them once: if their HP falls to zero, they'll be destroyed forever.</eng>
					</tier2>
					<tier3>
						<eng>You will encounter only Ranged attackers on this map. Use your Enhancer Beacons and Heat Ray Sentries wisely.</eng>

					<name>
						<eng>VI. - Nameless Tomb</eng>
					</name>
					<desc>
						<eng>Long before the First Swarm broke out of the black, pulsating heart of the Ink, the otherworld had been home to god-like creatures who waged wars among themselves for fun and erected grandiose monuments to herald their own greatness. This particular stronghold was built among the ruins of a colossal tomb dedicated to one of those inhuman generals of the lost age. According to the scholars of the Crawling Monastery, it should be a burial place, although no one has ever ventured deep enough to see if there was a crypt in the darkness. And judging by the macabre silence that fills these vaults, maybe it’s better this way.</eng>
					</desc>
					<tier2>
						<eng>Build a lot of Enhancer Beacons in the same area: since these traps will boost the damage dealt by you traps, you should place as many as possible close to each other.</eng>
					</tier2>
					<tier3>
						<eng>Watch out: only Flying creatures will attack you on this map, and they will avoid the usual land routes to your Gate. Hook Grinders and Artillery Sentries will help you to deal with them.</eng>
					</tier3>
					<tier4>
						<eng>Beware! This map has no average trap slots at all! You can only build Artillery Sentry traps, although the number of available Artillery Sentries is quite big. Tip: try to gather as much Essence as you can.</eng>

					<name>
						<eng>VII. - Cave of Valor</eng>
					</name>
					<desc>
						<eng>The majestic ring of islands floating around the Inkheart was once a hub of leisure for the wealthy citizens of a long-lost civilization, since these plateaus offer breathtaking vistas of the churning, black chaos from a safe distance. Some of these islands, though, catered for visitors who craved for pleasures of a more decadent kind, and the arenas of crystal and marble hosted grandiose battles between gladiators. When the Trapmakers began to build their first strongholds, they decided to make good use of these abandoned vaults. Where once gladiators fought to death, now monsters die shrieking.</eng>

						<eng>With proper tactics the slow, but deadly Artillery Sentries can rain concentrated fire upon your enemies.</eng>

						<eng>This map is not for the faint-hearted. There are no regular monsters this time, only Champions will enter the arena. Keep your Imprisoned Golems in the fight!</eng>

						<eng>Attention! You can only use Mystic and Mechanical Ground Traps on this map. Be prepared for a large number of Armored creatures as well.</eng>

						<eng>VIII. - Plateau of Decay</eng>
					</name>
					<desc>
						<eng>This is an eerie, haunted maze of colossal stone bridges and stairs that seem to lead nowhere. The historians of the Crawling Monastery believe that the Plateau was originally an ordinary floating island just like the others in the Ring around the Inkheart, but it was carved, shaped and sculpted until nothing else remained but a twisted, strange stone skeleton. The purpose of the endless rows of corroded chains and iron rings embedded in the walls is still unclear, but they certainly remind the visitors of a prison for inhuman creatures, shackled to the slabs floating above the void.</eng>
					</desc>
					<tier2>
						<eng>Beware! This map doesn't allow you to build Tower Traps. Use the vicious Hook Grinders instead. Try to use Ground traps or clever tactics to make the best use of them.</eng>
					</tier2>
					<tier3>
						<eng>Flying creatures will take shortcuts to your gate, so make good use of Empower Beacons and Wind of Death traps.</eng>
					</tier3>

						<eng>IX. - Abandoned Laboratories</eng>
					</name>
					<desc>
						<eng>Some of the strongholds were built in the colossal vaults where the Trapmakers used to experiment with their first killing devices. Mystery shrouds those early days, and from the few remaining notes it seems that they had some truly strange ideas, like platforms that could trap you in a god’s dream or sigils that could conjure thunderstorms. For reasons unknown they eventually abandoned these designs just as they left behind their laboratories. Ironically some of these places became forts where the swarms can relive the history of their previous defeats.</eng>
					</desc>
					<tier2>
						<eng>The Metamorpher Sentries fire in a tight angle. Kill the weakened monsters before they change back to their original shapes. Beware: transmorphed creatures move with a much greater speed!</eng>
					</tier2>
					<tier3>
						<eng>Teleporting, rushing, cloaking monsters will try to overrun your defenses. You will have to fight with very limited resources. Salvage Recyclers and Enhancer Beacons will help you in the struggle.</eng>
					</tier3>
					<tier4>
						<eng>This map only has Mechanical Tower slots and Mechanical Ground Trap slots, apart from some special traps unique to this map. Tip: keep an eye on the approaching waves, observe which creatures follow which lanes.</eng>

						<eng>X. - Black Warrens</eng>
					</name>
					<desc>
						<eng>The archeologists dedicated to the study of the Deathtrap Strongholds have long argued over the question of whether this haunted place was once a factory dedicated to the manufacturing of the occult mechanisms or a place of worship to a long-forgotten machine god. We might never know for sure, but the obsidian platforms, the cast-iron girdles, the chaotic maze of staircases and the gloomy chasms definitely have an air of grim sanctity - a sanctitiy that will be desecrated every time the Chaos Portals disgorge their shrieking hordes onto the black, empty floors.</eng>
					</desc>
					<tier2>
						<eng>Important notice: you'll start this map with extremely limited Essence and you can only gain Essence with the Salvage Recyclers. Always consider carefully what you want to build next.</eng>
					</tier2>
					<tier3>
						<eng>Only giants will roam the Warrens this time! You will need strong trap clusters to counter and halt the tide. Use the Metamorpher Sentries cleverly and they will make your job much easier.</eng>
					</tier3>
					<tier4>
						<eng>Beware the flying creatures! You'll have to face a lot of those nasties here. And to make it slightly more interesting, there are only Summoning and Mystic Ground trap slots on this map.</eng>

						<eng>XI. - Necropolis</eng>
					</name>
					<desc>
						<eng>The islands of the Ink have seen the rise and fall of many strange empires. Most of these cultures hardly had anything in common, apart from the veneration of their fallen brethren and the need to build grandiose monuments to honor the departed. There are still countless shrines in the Ink dedicated to the dead, most of them lost forever or protected by ancient charms. But this graveyard is too close to the Inkheart, so it became a battleground ages ago... small consolation, but at least the fallen heroes have their monuments prepared for them.</eng>
					</desc>
					<tier2>
						<eng>Unlike most levels, this map grants you clusters where the trap slots converge. You can save a lot of Essence if you build Service Stations first.</eng>
					</tier2>
					<tier3>
						<eng>This time you'll face summoners and undead creatures who can call their minions into battle or raise the dead. Prepare for a last ditch effort near your Gate and a stunningly large number of attackers.</eng>
					</tier3>
					<tier4>
						<eng>You can only use Tower traps on this map. Forget all your other traps this time: it's a tale of the two... three... well, a lot of towers.</eng>

						<eng>XII. - Wounded Crag</eng>
					</name>
					<desc>
						<eng>The closer you get to the Inkheart, the more destructive the pull of the seething darkness becomes. Here you can almost feel the presence of that gaping void out in the mists. Relentless forces have been slowly grinding away this island for millennia: for all we know, this fortress once could have been a pleasure garden, a forested plateau or a castle of ivory and silver, but now it is nothing but a wounded place, floating chunks of lifeless rocks and rusted chains, where the air is heavy with despair.</eng>
					</desc>
					<tier2>
						<eng>Word of advice: focus on Wind of Death traps scattered all over the map. They can turn the tide even in the most desperate situation.</eng>
					</tier2>
					<tier3>
						<eng>Brace yourself for the most annoying gathering of monsters: they'll freeze traps and turn brave heroes to ice! Tip: Heat Ray clusters and Squash Traps might come handy.</eng>
					</tier3>
					<tier4>
						<eng>This map only allows you to build Mystic Tower traps and Mechanical Ground traps. If you want survive, try to combine these two trap types as often as you can. Good luck!</eng>

						<eng>XIII. - Inkheart</eng>
					</name>
					<desc>
						<eng>The Inkheart is a mystery, an absence of something colossal, a gap that distorts time and space in its vicinity. Countless generations of scholars have devoted their lives to the study of this anomaly, and the most plausible theory so far is that the Inkheart is all that remained of a civilization that had manipulated the dream-material of the Ink until they destroyed themselves and left a festering wound in the void that still gorges out their own nightmares from time to time. This fortress is too close to the Inkheart... and the presence of darkness is the most powerful here.</eng>
					</desc>
					<tier2>
						<eng>Heat Ray Sentries increase their damage per second, so you might want to keep the targeted monster in their crosshairs. They can save you a lot of trouble on this map, where Tower Traps slots are very limited.</eng>

						<eng>Imprisoned Golems will be your first line of  defense on this map, where you will face multiple Bosses at the end of each wave!</eng>

						<eng>Mistbound Island</eng>
					</name>
					<desc>
						<eng>This gigantic, floating chunk of rock with its crudely carved ledges, twisting stairwells and rusty chains was once part of a larger floating island that was eventually worn away by the constant pull of the Inkheart. As it fell apart, the smaller pieces drifted even closer to the whirling darkness, and some of them, like the Mistbound Island, were swallowed by the haze surrounding that ageless anomaly, only to reappear later undamaged, but without any trace of living vegetation.</eng>

						<eng>Hallowed Ground</eng>
					</name>
					<desc>
						<eng>The necropolises in the Ink are abandoned places, for numerous reasons. Most wanderers avoid these sacred grounds because they respect the silence of the departed. Certain graveyards, on the other hand, have fearsome reputations: the tales of haunted tombs, tainted air and the aura of evil presence repel adventurers and vagabonds. But what happens if one of these infamous graveyard islands happens to float around the Inkheart? Rest assured: nothing good will come out of that.</eng>

						<eng>Cavern of Marble and Brass</eng>

					<desc>
						<eng>This gigantic hall used to be part of a larger underground residence, one of the secret palaces built by the royal family of a kingdom long extinct. The echoing, ornamental chamber must have been a ballroom or even a throne room, filled with music, laughter and clamor until the Trapmakers turned it into a mechanical and magical battleground, where the only sound now is the noise of the traps... mingling with the shrieks of dying monsters.</eng>

						<eng>A very long time ago, long before the Inkheart burst for the first time, this chamber was one of the fortified halls that belonged to the Red Knight. He was a legendary champion of justice, who frequently participated in knightly adventures until he failed to return from one his bold quests. This empty hall was later dedicated to the memory of the Red Knight and his fellow champions who always followed him into danger.</eng>

A sudden twist of fate eventually turned the memorial into an actual Stronghold, and the empty eyes of the giant statues seem to look at the battles almost longingly... or with contempt. No one could know for sure.</eng>

			</Physicsdetail>
			<Popup>				
				<Antialias>
					<eng>Improves the appearance of polygon edges so they don't look jagged. If you have a medium-range graphics card (or lower), choosing this option might cause lags.</eng>
				</Antialias>
				<Character>
					<eng>Enhances model details and improves the visuals of the characters. Turning it down could enhance performance on PCs with low-level video cards.</eng>
				</Character>				
				<HDRRender>
					<eng>Enhances all weather effects, but requires substantial video card memory. If you experience lags in the game, it is recommended that you turn this option off.</eng>
				</HDRRender>
				<HighShaders>
					<eng>Enhances texture details, shadows and lightning. This setting will make the game run considerably slower on PCs with mid-level CPUs.</eng>
				</HighShaders>
				<DetailedEnvironment>
					<eng>If you have a processor with low-level performance, it is recommended to switch this option off: the game will use low-detailed environments only.</eng>
				</DetailedEnvironment>
				<HighEffects>
					<eng>Enables detailed effects and atmospheric particle systems on the map. Switching off this option will significantly enhance game performance.</eng>
				</HighEffects>
				<Reflections>
					<eng>Enables reflection on watery surfaces. Not recommended on PCs with medium-range CPUs or video cards.</eng>
				</Reflections>
				<OrganicsPhysics>
					<eng>Moving units will interact with plants on the maps. Not recommended on PCs with very low-range video cards.</eng>
				</OrganicsPhysics>
				<OrganicsAnimation>
					<eng>Enables the animation of plants and trees. Not recommended on processors with low-level performance.</eng>
				</OrganicsAnimation>
				<NoSoftCoronas>
					<eng>Enables the soft, misty effect on certain maps. Recommended for all configurations.</eng>
				</NoSoftCoronas>
				<ForceWaitGPU>
					<eng>Forces the CPU to wait for the GPU to finish before starting a new frame. Recommended if you experience any unexplained stuttering.</eng>
				</ForceWaitGPU>
				<MultiGPU>
					<eng>This option will optimize rendering processes for SLI/CrossFire configuration. It also degrades visual quality of Organics Physics simulation.</eng>
				</MultiGPU>				
				<Parallax>
					<eng>Enhances the details of the terrain. Enabling this option could make the game run slower on mid- or low-range video cards.</eng>
				</Parallax>
				<Physics>
					<eng>This option sets the maximum number of units affected by physics simulation in a given area. Minimum requirement: 3 core processor.</eng>
				</Physics>
				<ShadowDetail>
					<eng>Enhances the shadows in the game. Not recommended to set it above medium on PCs with mid- or low-level performance. The highest setting is recommended for premium video cards only.</eng>
				</ShadowDetail>
				<SmoothAnimations>
					<eng>Enhances and improves animations. Not recommended on PCs with very low-range video cards.</eng>
				</SmoothAnimations>
				<SmoothShadows>
					<eng>Improves the shadows in the game. It is not recommended to turn it on on PCs with low-range video cards.</eng>
				</SmoothShadows>
				<Texture>
					<eng>Enhances textures. The higher you set the details, the more beautiful the game will look and it requires significantly more graphics card memory.</eng>
				</Texture>				
				<VSync>
					<eng>This option will synchronize the video card refresh rate to the displayâ€™s refresh and prevents phase difference. It could, however, slow down the overall performance and occasionally makes the game camera lag.</eng>
				</VSync>
				<FPSLimit>
					<eng>Choose from the list the frame-per-second rate you would like to use.</eng>
				</FPSLimit>
				<affectguiresolution>
					<eng>If this option is on, the user interface will be displayed in the same resolution as the rest of the game. It is recommended to leave this option turned off except if you are using SLI/CrossFire configuration.</eng>
